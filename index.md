### About the Book

Organizations donâ€™t implement analytics, people do. In this book, we uncover how individual analytic professionals can communicate and implement change at the person-to-person level. Navigating an analytics project from requirements definition to deployment often requires more than technical expertise and soft skills. Successful implementation of singular projects relies on subtle factors such as trust and experience, while transition to a data culture that fosters analytics requires change management strategy.

Through case studies and interviews of analytics professionals, this text provides readers with an understanding of key elements that can increase the probability of implementation of their analytic solutions. We introduce the formula "Trust + Experience + Effective Communications + Analytics > Convince Me." The Convince Me stakeholder represents the person that must be convinced. This might be an analytics team member, team lead, decision-maker, or senior leader. The contributing factors do not exist in a vacuum and their interactions and relationship with time is discussed. Each section of the text includes a real-world analytics example and questions for discussion.
